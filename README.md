Inspired by [the GestionAir StarterKit : https://github.com/GestionAIR/StarterKit](https://github.com/GestionAIR/StarterKit)

## Getting Started

This project requires [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/).

From the project's directory execute :

```
$ npm -g install grunt-cli bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Run project with Grunt.

```
$ grunt
```

## Critical CSS

Sasserkit uses the grunt contrib for [criticalcss](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunt-criticalcss). When you launch grunt, it generates critical css files in css/critical/.. that you can copy, paste and inline in the head of your html.

## Switch from LESS to SASS (work in progress)
